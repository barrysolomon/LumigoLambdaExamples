The error you're seeing (`Runtime.ImportModuleError`) indicates that the `aws-sdk` module is not found. This happens because `aws-sdk` is not automatically bundled in recent AWS Lambda runtimes like `nodejs18.x`, which expect you to add it explicitly if needed.

Here’s how to resolve this:

Disclaimer: This and the other READEMEs were generated by chatGPT.  They look correct, but I have not followed their steps from scratch.

### Option 1: Update the Lambda Code to Not Import `aws-sdk` (Recommended)

In recent AWS Lambda Node.js runtimes (starting from Node.js 12.x), the `aws-sdk` is available natively and doesn’t need to be imported in your code. You can simply remove `const AWS = require('aws-sdk');` from your Lambda code, and it will use the built-in AWS SDK.

### Option 2: Explicitly Include `aws-sdk` in Your Project (Not Recommended but Possible)

If you want to explicitly include `aws-sdk` (though not typically necessary), you can install it in each Lambda directory.

1. Install `aws-sdk` in both directories:

   ```bash
   cd logAndTriggerLambda
   npm install aws-sdk
   cd ../triggeredLambda
   npm install aws-sdk
   cd ..
   ```

2. Re-zip both Lambda directories with the updated `node_modules` and deploy them again as shown below:

   ```bash
   cd logAndTriggerLambda
   zip -r ../logAndTriggerLambda.zip .
   cd ../triggeredLambda
   zip -r ../triggeredLambda.zip .
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Redeploy** the Lambdas:

   ```bash
   aws lambda update-function-code --function-name logAndTriggerLambda --zip-file fileb://logAndTriggerLambda.zip
   aws lambda update-function-code --function-name triggeredLambda --zip-file fileb://triggeredLambda.zip
   ```

### Adjust the Lambda Timeout Setting

The task timeout of 3 seconds is another issue. You can increase the Lambda’s timeout to allow for more processing time:

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name logAndTriggerLambda --timeout 10
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name triggeredLambda --timeout 10
```

With these adjustments, your Lambda functions should run without the module error or timeout issues.
